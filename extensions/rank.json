It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock",

Plot functions, create tables, add sliders, animate your graphs, and more -- all for free. \n\nAt Desmos, we imagine a world of universal math literacy and envision a world where math is accessible and enjoyable for all students. We believe the key is learning by doing.\n\nTo achieve this vision, we’ve started by building the next generation of the graphing calculator. Using our powerful and blazingly-fast math engine, the calculator can instantly plot any equation, from lines and parabolas up through derivatives and Fourier series. Sliders make it a breeze to demonstrate function transformations. It's intuitive, beautiful math. And best of all: it's completely free. \n\nFeatures:\n\nGraphing: Plot polar, cartesian, or parametric graphs. There’s no limit to how many expressions you can graph at one time - and you don’t even need to enter expressions in y= form!\n\nSliders: Adjust values interactively to build intuition, or animate any parameter to visualize its effect on the graph\n\nTables: Input and plot data, or create an input-output table for any function\n\nStatistics: Find best-fit lines, parabolas, and more. \n\nZooming: Scale the axes independently or at the same time with the pinch of two fingers, or edit the window size manually to get the perfect window.\n\nPoints of Interest: Touch a curve to show maximums, minimums, and points of intersection. Tap the gray points of interest to see their coordinates. Hold and drag along a curve to see the coordinates change under your finger.\n\nScientific Calculator: Just type in any equation you want to solve and Desmos will show you the answer. It can handle square roots, logs, absolute value, and more.\n\nInequalities: Plot cartesian and polar inequalities.\n\nVisit www.desmos.com to learn more.",

      "full_description": ".\nTop 10 Chrome extension since 2009!\n\n-- WINDOWS ONLY -- WINDOWS ONLY --\n\nIE Tab exactly emulates IE by using the IE rendering engine directly within Chrome.  This will enable you to use ActiveX controls and test your web pages with different versions of IE (IE6, IE7, IE8, or IE9).\n\n-- FEATURES --\n\n* Create a list of URLs that will automatically open in IE Tab\n\n* Group Policy support for enterprise deployments\n\n* Securely use the old IE rendering engine\n\n* Edit Sharepoint documents instead of opening read-only\n\n* Use Java, Silverlight, and ActiveX in Chrome seamlessly\n\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n1. Why do I have to install ietabhelper.exe?\n\nIE Tab uses the Internet Explorer rendering engine. This rendering engine can't be directly accessed from a Chrome extension, so we need a helper process to talk between the Chrome extension and the rendering engine. \n\n2. Did IE Tab always require this extra program?\n\nNo. Chrome used to support a technology called NPAPI (the Netscape Plugin API) which allowed extensions to access local computer resources. IE Tab used to use that functionality to access the Internet Explorer rendering engine. But Chrome removed NPAPI support, so we were forced to implement a new solution, and that solution requires a separate helper executable. From a technical standpoint, the only real change is that our code moved from an NPAPI .DLL file to a helper .EXE file. \n\n3. Is the IE Tab Helper application safe?\n\nAbsolutely! IE Tab has always used native code, and we have always treated the security of our 2+ million users very seriously. So you can rest assured that this helper executable is secure and trustworthy. \n\n4. I'm an enterprise customer, how do I deploy the IE Tab Helper automatically?\n\nWe have enterprise deployment options, please contact us at support@ietab.net for details. \n\n\nThe Privacy Policy for the IE Tab extension can be found here:  http://www.ietab.net/privacy.html",

      "full_description": "Easily check Google Calendar and add new events from websites you visit.\n\nGet a button on your browser toolbar that you can easily click to see upcoming events from Google Calendar, without ever leaving your page. And if you’re on sites that have special events encoded, you can click the button to instantly add events to your calendar. The button shows an orange plus sign whenever there are events on the page you’re viewing that can be added to your calendar.\n\nWHAT’S NEW: https://github.com/manastungare/google-calendar-crx/wiki/Changes\n\nFEATURES\n • Displays events from your selected calendars.\n • Quick Add: When adding events, you no longer need to specify a time separately. Type events such as:\n  — “Dinner with Sam at 8pm Sunday”, or\n  — “Vacation from Dec 25 to Dec 31”\n • If you’re on certain sites where it detects the presence of events, the icon changes to an orange “+”. Clicking that icon lets you add the event to your Google Calendar, and shows you a map (if there’s a location it could detect.)\n • Any site that uses the hCalendar microformat or derivative microformats such as hResume are supported.\n • This extension shows events from whatever calendars you are logged in within Chrome.\n • If you want to use a Google Apps calendar, you should login to that account first, then open the extension.\n\nFeatured on the Chrome Blog as a “By Google” extension:\nhttp://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/11/new-chrome-extensions-by-google.html\n\nPre-release versions & source code of this extension available at:\nhttps://github.com/manastungare/google-calendar-crx",

Explore an engaging new game mode with a wild twist, two stylish maps, and a daily challenge to see who is the best at Entanglement!\n\nSakura Grove - A completely new game-play mode for Entanglement! You have a spacious garden surrounded by cherry trees, but you have a limited number of tiles to play. Acquire more tiles by directing your path through one of the cherry trees, which blooms every time you pass through it.\n\nHana Blossom - A new flower-shaped map for Entanglement with the original rules. The map is larger but the petals provide an interesting challenge; it’s easy to get into one, but make sure to plan your way out, or your game will end quickly! This is a wonderful challenge for advanced Entanglement players.\n\nLotus Petal - A new tiny map for Entanglement also using the original rules. It is a great training ground to practice your ability to string together long paths and plan future moves. You can also play the map quickly enough to have a nice slice of Entanglement fun in the time of a commercial break.\n\nDaily Challenge - A new challenge every day for Entanglement players! All players are given the exact same set of tiles for the entire day, competing on strategy alone for the daily championship!\n\nThis expansion is available for Entanglement enthusiasts for $1.99 via Google Checkout or PayPal.\n\n---\n\nThanks for playing Entanglement!

      "full_description": "NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nPermissions explained for the privacy conscious:\n\n- history - the history permission is required in order to add URLs that you expand using the inline image viewer to your history (e.g. \"make them purple\")\n\n- cookies - the cookies permission is required for Account Switcher to work. RES needs to be able to reset your logged-in cookie before attempting to log you into another account.\n\n- tabs - the tabs permission allows RES to communicate between open tabs of reddit so that a change you make to settings, data, etc in one tab is propagated to other reddit tabs you have open.\n\n- flickr, imgur, other sites: - this is the one where google really upsets me... they say \"RES has access to your data on ... sites\" -- this is NOT THE CASE. RES needs permission to call out to imgur, flickr etc in order to get the direct URL to each image in an album, for example -- or to flickr to get the direct URL to the one image that is linked. This is what allows you to expand it without leaving the homepage.\n\nPermissions are further explained on our wiki page here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/permissions - RES has always had history and tabs permissions because it needs to be able to mark image links purple when you expand them. There is absolutely no collection or sale of your data going on whatsoever.\n\nReddit Enhancement Suite is a suite of tools to enhance your Reddit browsing experience.  It includes features such as:\n\n- Never Ending Reddit - never click \"next page\" again!\n\n- Inline Image Viewer - adds buttons to view images without leaving the page, including support for imgur albums and more\n\n- Keyboard Navigation - browse reddit more efficiently than ever before with keyboard shortcuts for most functionality\n\n- Uppers and Downers - see the hidden vote totals that Reddit provides behind the scenes\n\n- Account Switcher - switch accounts easily and quickly\n\n- User  Tagger - keep track of users you run across frequently, complete with color coded tags, etc.\n\nTo read more about the features of Reddit Enhancement Suite, please see http://redditenhancementsuite.com/\n\nNOTE: Chrome's description of permissions is a little bit scarier sounding that it probably should be. When it says \"RES can access your data on [sites]\", what it means is that RES can make requests to those sites. RES uses API calls to sites like flickr, imgur, twitter and others to bring data in without you having to leave the page you're on.",
