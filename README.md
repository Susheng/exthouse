Exthouse - tool, powered by [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse), provides with report (Lighthouse style ðŸ˜Ž) about impact on user performance by calculating all additional work extension added to the browser.

## Install

Install CLI using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install --global exthouse
```

## Motivation

1. Highlight one more performance factor affecting web performance.
2. Identify web extensions that have negative impact on web performance.
3. Provide developers with tool to measure extension performance score, hence helps them to improve perforamnce of their extensions and web in general.
4. Show that not only mobile users struggling with issue regrading performance, but also users on a desktop but by other factors - web extensions.

## Methodology

Exthouse runs website in 2 modes (without any extension, and with installed extension), median run is selected to avoid local issues with local environment.
Using Lighthouse to evaluate performance, compares results and defines recommendations

### Environment conditions

- Extensions installed and sites are opened using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and Chromium browser.
- Lighthouse run with: `throttlingMethod: devtools`, `emulatedFormFactor: 'desktop'`. `cpuSlowdownMultiplier: 2`. More settings in [config](/src/utils/measure-chromium.js#L7).

### Measured metrics

- Time to interactive (TTI) - Time to interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive).
- First input delay (FID) - The change for the longest task duration highlights the impact on potential First Input Delay. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/first-input-delay).

### Scoring algorithm

It's based on [Lighthouse scoring algorithm](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/scoring.md#how-are-the-scores-weighted).

Exthouse adds extra audits to calculate performance score:

- `exthouse-new-long-tasks` - The value represents a sum of Long Tasks. [Long Tasks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API) (weight: 1).
- `exthouse-max-potential-fid-change` - The change for the longest task duration highlights the impact on potential First Input Delay (weight: 1).
- `exthouse-extension-files` - Extension files add extra CPU consumption for every URL visit. Bundle resources into one and leverage hot chaching. [Learn more](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs) (weight: 1).
- `exthouse-default-metrics` - All metrics collected from the default run (without extension) (weight: 0).

## Usage

```bash
exthouse [path/to/extension.crx] [options]

# Example
exthouse Grammarly-for-Chrome.crx --runs=3
```

**`$ exthouse --help`**

```
Options:
  --runs <number>    amount of runs to evaluate median performance value (default: "1")
  --url <url>        url to evaluate extension performance (default: "https://example.com/")
  --format <format>  output format options: [json,html] (default: "html")
  --disableGather    disable gathering and use /exthouse to produce results
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -h, --help         output usage information
```

## Data

### Summary

Extensions fetched from [Chrome Extensions Archive](https://crx.dam.io/) which includes 176,323 extensions and 396,057 versions ranked by number of users downloaded them.

### Top 20 extensions from Chrome Web Store

Extensions were filtered to exclude extensions require login and not relevant extensions in categories like PLATFORM_APP.
They are placed in `./exensions/chrome-top-20` folder.

## Evaluate any extension

1. Download extension using https://chrome-extension-downloader.com/
2. Copy path to the `MY_EXTENTION.crx` and pass to cli `exthouse MY_EXTENTION.crx --runs=3`
3. The process takes a few minutes and result are stored in the [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) report.
4. All debug data is stored in `exthouse` folder.

## Future Work

- experiment with cache (try: cold, warm, hot) to see how scripts are effected by caching in affecting CPU. [More about cache](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs).
- experiment with results, running in Chrome and Edge. Add flag `browserBinaryPath`.
- expose node.js API.
- `exthouse-new-long-tasks`: reformat table, 2 rows with old tasks and new tasks.
- make repo smaller. Try [bfg-repo-cleaner](https://github.com/rtyley/bfg-repo-cleaner).
- proceed with Firefox add-ons experiments (all related work is in branch `firefox-experimental`).
