## Motivation

Often, measuring real user performance engineers take to the account factors, like device and network conditions.
But there is one more factor, that is not in direct control - web extensions. They add additional scripts, DOM manipulations, and impacts user experience.

Exthouse is a tool powered by [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse), that provides a report about web extension impact on user performance.
It measures extension performance score, that helps developers to improve the performance of their extensions and web in general.

Inspired by https://twitter.com/denar90_/status/1065712688037277696

## Goals

1. Highlight one more performance factor affecting web performance.
2. Identify web extensions that have a negative impact on web performance.
3. Provide developers with reports they can use to improve performance.
4. Show that desktop users struggling with performance issues - web extensions.

## Install

Install CLI using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install --global exthouse
```

## Methodology

To do analysis, Exthouse evaluates several main steps:

1. Unzip provided `MY_EXTENTION.crx` file.

2. Launches a browser 2 times:


    During the first launch:

    - URL is opened and performance results gathered.
    - Lighthouse performance results are stored in `./exthouse/result-default-1.json`.

    During the second launch:

    - Extension installed using Puppeteer.
    - URL is opened and performance results gathered.
    - Lighthouse performance results are stored in `./exthouse/MY_EXTENTION-1.json`.

3. Extends Lighthouse performance categories with additional:


    - `exthouse-new-long-tasks` - The value represents a sum of Long Tasks. [Long Tasks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API) (weight: 1).
    - `exthouse-max-potential-fid-change` - The change for the longest task duration highlights the impact on potential First Input Delay (weight: 1).
    - `exthouse-extension-files` - Extension files add extra CPU consumption for every URL visit. Bundle resources into one and leverage hot chaching. [Learn more](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs) (weight: 1).
    - `exthouse-default-metrics` - All metrics collected from the default run (without extension) (weight: 0).

    Note: Scoring algorithm is based on [Lighthouse scoring algorithm](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/scoring.md#how-are-the-scores-weighted).

4. Generates Lighthouse style report.

### Environment conditions

- Browser: `Chromium`
- Emulated form factor: `desktop`
- CPU slowdown multiplier: `2`

More settings in [Lighthouse config](/src/utils/measure-chromium.js#L7).

### Measured metrics

Most of the extensions add tasks to the main thread and load CPU. These tasks affect interactive metrics.

- Time to interactive (TTI) - Time to interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive).
- First input delay (FID) - The change for the longest task duration highlights the impact on potential First Input Delay. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/first-input-delay).

## Usage

**`exthouse [path/to/extension.crx] [options]`**

**`$ exthouse --help`**

```
Options:
  --runs <number>    amount of runs to evaluate median performance value (default: "1")
  --url <url>        url to evaluate extension performance (default: "https://example.com/")
  --format <format>  output format options: [json,html] (default: "html")
  --disableGather    disable gathering and use /exthouse to produce results
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -h, --help         output usage information
```

### Examples

- Evaluate extensions with several runs:

  **`$ exthouse Grammarly-for-Chrome.crx --runs=3`**

  Will do 3 runs, get median value and generate a report

- Generate a report based on existing data:

  **`$ exthouse Grammarly-for-Chrome.crx --disableGather`**

  Will read results from `/exthouse` folder and generate report.

- Output report in json format:

  **`$ exthouse Grammarly-for-Chrome.crx --format=json`**

## Evaluate any extension

1. Download extension using https://chrome-extension-downloader.com/
2. Copy path to the `MY_EXTENTION.crx` and pass to cli `exthouse MY_EXTENTION.crx --runs=3`
3. The process takes a few minutes and results are stored in the [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) report.
4. All debug data is stored in `exthouse` folder.

## Data

### Summary

Extensions fetched from [Chrome Extensions Archive](https://crx.dam.io/) which includes 176,323 extensions and 396,057 versions ranked by number of users downloaded them.

Extensions were filtered to exclude extensions: requires login, not relevant extensions in categories like PLATFORM_APP or related to specific pages like `*://*.google.com/*`.
Extensions are placed in `./exensions/chrome-top-20` folder.

## Future Work

- [ ] add support for login script to test extensions required authentication ([#22](https://github.com/treosh/exthouse/issues/22))
- [ ] do extensions analysis required authentication and compare score w/o authentication. [#25](https://github.com/treosh/exthouse/issues/25)
- [ ] experiment with cache (try: warm, hot) to see how scripts are effected by v8 caching. [More about cache](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs).
- [ ] experiment with results, running in Chrome and Edge. Add flag `browserBinaryPath`
- [ ] expose node.js API ([#24](https://github.com/treosh/exthouse/issues/24))
- [ ] experiment with Firefox add-ons (all related work is in the branch [firefox-experimental](https://github.com/treosh/exthouse/tree/firefox-experimental)).
- [ ] make repo smaller, try [bfg-repo-cleaner](https://github.com/rtyley/bfg-repo-cleaner).
